# Stock Predictor
In this notebook, I assign a simple challenge: Predicting if the price of a stock will rise or fall before the end of the day.
The algorithm used is XGBoost, which in this case is used in combination with Time Series Analysis in order to achieve a final precision of 0.69 on the test dataset.
